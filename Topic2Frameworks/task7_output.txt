It sounds like you might benefit from taking steps to protect yourself from excessive sun exposure. Here are some tips:

1. Use sunscreen with at least SPF 30 every day.
2. Reapply sunscreen frequently, especially after swimming or sweating.
3. Wear protective clothing such as wide-brimmed hats and long-sleeved shirts.
4. Seek shade during peak sunlight hours (usually between 10 AM and 4 PM).
5. Avoid tanning beds and other sources of UV radiation.

Remember, prevention is key!
