QUESTION: How do I fix a slipping transmission band?

------------------------------------------------------------
TOP_K = 1
The context states that you can loosen the lock nut at the tight side of the transmission cover and turn the adjusting screw to tighten the slow speed band. Additionally, to tighten the brake and reverse bands, you should remove the transmission cover. However, it mentions that this process may not always work due to the possibility of dropping the bands into the transmission case, which makes recovery nearly impossible. Therefore, the recommended method for fixing a slipping transmission band involves loosening the lock nut and adjusting the screw as described, but with caution since there's ...
