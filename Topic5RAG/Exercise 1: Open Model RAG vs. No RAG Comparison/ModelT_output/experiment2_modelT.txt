Based on the given context, there is no specific mention of the recommended spark plug gap for a Model T Ford. However, it does state that "All wire connections to spark plugs, coil box and commutator should, of course, at all times be kept in perfect contact." This implies that proper electrical connection is important but does not specify an exact gap size. Therefore, without more detailed specifications, we cannot determine the precise correct spark plug gap for a Model T Ford from this infor...

According to the text, the correct spark plug gap for a Model T Ford is approximately 7/16 inch (about the thickness of a smooth dime). The instruction states "The distance between' the sparking points should be 74", which corresponds to 7/16 inch. Therefore, the correct spark plug gap for a Model T Ford is 7/16 inch. 

This can be directly inferred from the last sentence of the given context, where it mentions "All wire connections to spark plugs, coil box and commutator should, of course, at a...
