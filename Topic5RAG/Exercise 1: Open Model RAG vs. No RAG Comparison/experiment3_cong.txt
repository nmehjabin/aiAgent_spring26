uring my lifetime, since I was born,
CEO pay has increased by over 1,000
percent, while worker pay has increased by 25 percent. On average,
right now, a CEO makes more in a single day than a worker does in an entire
year. The concentration of wealth and
power has given a small group of
superelites the ability to make all the

circling Milwaukee. Why these colors?
Well, for one, because they are the colors of Milwaukee’s own Marquette University. And for two, because of the
hard work of a woman named Rana Altenburg.
With more than 30 years serving as
Marquette University associate vice
president for public affairs, Rana Altenburg’s legacy reaches far beyond
choosing those two colors while she

Answer: Based on the information provided in the context, there is no mention of any specific CEO or their favorite color. Therefore, the correct answer is:

The context does not provide information about the CEO's favorite color. 

Relevant quote from the context: "Why these colors? Well, for one, because they are the colors of Milwaukee's own Marquette University. And for two, because of the hard work of a woman named Rana Altenburg." This statement discusses the choice of colors for a project related to Marquette University, but it does not indicate whether Rana Altenburg, who chaired the Marquette Interchange Color Committee, had a favorite color or if any other CEO mentioned in the context had a favorite color. To determine the CEO's favorite color, additional information would be needed.
