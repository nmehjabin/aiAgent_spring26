Q02,procedural,How do I fix a slipping transmission band?,0.6008,0.6008,0.0,0.1107,0.0437,10,0.4,"Loosen the lock nut at the tight side of the transmission cover, then adjust the screw (see Cut No. 12). Tighten the brake and reverse bands by removing the transmission cover. Ensure the bands don't drag the drums when disengaging, as this can cause overheating of the motor.

This answer provides instructions for fixing a slipping transmission band by loosening the lock nut, adjusting the screw, tightening the brake and reverse bands, and ensuring proper alignment between the drum and the bands during disengagement. It also mentions that improper adjustment could lead to overheating of the motor. However, there's no mention of how to prevent slipping altogether, only what to do when it occurs. There's also some confusion about whether the slip is due to the clutch release ring or the differential gears, but these details aren't relevant to answering the specific question asked.

Q05,multi_section,What are all the steps to prepare a Model T for winter driving?,0.4465,0.4465,0.0,0.092,0.0323,4,0.4,"Before attempting to start the car, fill the radiator with clean fresh water. Strain it if necessary to prevent foreign matter from entering and obstructing the small tubes of the radiator. Store the car in a dark room not exposed to extreme temperatures when it's been stored for more than a month. Keep the inner tube repaired if necessary. Ensure proper file work on the cutlery handle. Adjustments should be made by the owner themselves, but they should only make adjustments after satisfactory service has been provided by an authorized Ford dealer. The entire Ford organization aims to keep every individual Ford car operating at its lowest possible cost. To avoid damage during winter driving, drive slowly and carefully, avoiding sharp turns, locking the wheels with the brakes, running in street car tracks, ruts, or bumping the sides of the tire against curbings. Paint the wheel rims each season and keep them free from rust. Jacking up the car can help if it's been parked for several months. Remember to check the running speeds needed for driving in different weather conditions. Always ensure that the car is properly serviced before starting it.","To prepare a Model T for winter driving, follow these steps:

1. Slowly and carefully drive the vehicle, avoiding flat tires.
2. Avoid locking the wheels with the brakes, as no tire can withstand dragging over the pavement in this manner.
3. Do not run the vehicle in streetcar tracks, ruts, or bumping the sides of the tire against curb.
4. Paint the wheel rims each season and keep them free from rust.
5. When starting the engine when it's cold, adjust the carburetor dash adjustment one-quarter turn to allow a richer mixture of gasoline to be drawn into the cylinders.
6. Hold out the priming rod while turning the crank from six to eight turns in quick succession, or turn the motor over a few times with the starter.
7. If the engine is difficult to start, throw on the magneto switch and try again after waiting a few minutes. Alternatively, use another method of starting the engine by throwing on the magneto switch and holding out the priming rod while turning the crank from six to eight turns in quick succession, or turning the motor over a few times with the starter.

Foreign matter can get into the small tubes of the radiator if not prevented, so it's important to ensure the water circulating system has been filled properly. Water will run out of the overflow pipe onto the ground when the system has been filled correctly. It's recommended to examine the radiator frequently during the first few days of driving and keep it properly filled as needed. To avoid running the car under own power without filling the water circulating system, make sure to pour in the water until you're sure that both the radiator and the cylinder jacket are full of water. This ensures that there is no obstruction preventing proper circulation of coolant. Additionally, it's advised to remove any carbonized matter from the cylinder head and top of pistons to prevent further damage to the engine. Finally, after replacing the cylinder head gasket, turn the motor over 30 degrees to align the bolts for tightening them securely.","Before starting the car, fill the radiator by removing the cap at the top and pouring in clean fresh water until you're certain that both the radiator and the cylinder jacket are full of water.

Q10,ambiguous,How does the Ford engine work?,0.5868,0.566,0.0208,0.0366,0.0108,10,0.4,"The Ford engine works based on the principle of gasoline combustion. When gasoline is mixed with air and compressed, it undergoes rapid and intense chemical reaction known as explosion, causing a violent expansion that propels the pistons in the cylinders. This process is initiated by an electric spark generated by the magneto, which ignites the fuel-air mixture inside the cylinders. The pistons move up and down within the cylinders, converting the chemical energy of the explosion into mechanical energy that powers the vehicle's motion. Additionally, the exhaust system expels the spent gases after each cycle, completing the cycle and ensuring efficient operation of the engine. The entire process requires little time and can help avoid delays or accidents on the road, emphasizing the importance of proper mechanical adjustments. After setting everything correctly, the exhaust valve on the first cylinder should be open while the intake valve is closed, with all other valves positioned according to the diagram provided in Cut No. 3.","The Ford engine works based on the principle of gasoline combustion.
